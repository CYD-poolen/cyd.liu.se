title: X-forwarding now available on ssh.cyd.liu.se
---
You can now log on to ssh.cyd.liu.se and use programs that run with a graphical user interface. To try it out - give ssh the flag -X and then start a program with a GUI. If a program you want isn't installed - don't hesitate to email admin@cyd.liu.se and ask for it.   

Example:

`ssh -X USER@ssh.cyd.liu`

`gedit &`
