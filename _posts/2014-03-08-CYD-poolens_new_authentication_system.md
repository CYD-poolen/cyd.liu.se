title: CYD-poolens new authentication system
---
There are now four new computers in CYD-poolen. These computers are part of CYD-poolens new system for authenticating users against the LiU directory of users. If you sit by these computers and notice something isn't right - please report to admin@cyd.liu.se as always. 

We are always interested in what you all think about CYD.
