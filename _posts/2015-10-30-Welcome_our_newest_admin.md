title: Welcome our newest admin
---

As we thank Victor NÃ¤slund for the years he's spent working with us it's with a light heart we announce the end of our latest recruitment campaign and welcome Martin Estgren as the newest system administrator of CYD-poolen!

With his excellent knowledge of Linux administration he's for the past weeks been soaking up the inner workings of our architecture and will be ready to work with us in full effect starting the 1st of November.

In closing we hope that you will join us in welcoming Martin Estgren and in return we'll provide you with the best support we possibly can.

Christian and Hans-Filip\\
