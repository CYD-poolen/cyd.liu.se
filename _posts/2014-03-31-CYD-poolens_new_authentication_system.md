title: CYD-poolens new authentication system
---
CYD-poolen is now using a new authentication system. We have also pushed a new Windows 7 image with updated software and some added software. 

Your home folder is now hosted by LiU at fillager.liu.se. Your CYD-poolen files can be accessed from the drive X: under "Computer". In a near future these files will be migrated to your LiU-folder. 

New additions to our software library include, among others: 

Unity 3D
Qt Creator
Brixcc

If something in our new system doesn't live up to your expectations - please contact admin@cyd.liu.se.
