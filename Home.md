Vi kan försäkra er om att LiU vidtar alla åtgärder som går för att säkerställa en fungerande lösning. Vi står i ständig kontakt med vår leverantör och våra egna tekniker jobbar för fullt för att avhjälpa problemen._

_"Vi är väl medvetna om att det, mot bakgrund av att utskriftstjänsten är spridd till stora delar av universitetet, skapar stora problem för er verksamhet när tjänsten utan förvarning uteblir.

CYD-poolen is now upgraded, please read.

We have now upgraded all the computers to Windows 7. You can logon as usual and should hopefully not notice any big changes.

Since an upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 is not supported by Microsoft, we had to move your old files. To access them, use the library "Documents (XP)" or "Desktop (XP)" located on the left pane in any explorer window.

Your web-files have also been moved. If you are using a workstation, you find them at W:\. If you are logging in remotely using ssh.cyd.liu.se you find them at ``/www/<username>/htdocs``. 
Your web content is accessible at ``http://www.cyd.liu.se/~<username>``

Also, since the scanner lacks 64-bit drivers it has been removed. We will try to order a new one shortly.
